# Introduction

Mathematical programs with complementarity constraints (MPCC) are optimization problems of the form
```math
    \begin{aligned}
    \min \quad &\varphi := f(x, y, z) \\
    \text{s.t.} \quad &h(x, y, z) = 0 \\
    &g(x, y, z) \ge 0 \\
    &0 \le x \perp y \ge 0
    \end{aligned}  
```
in which the last constraint means that either ``x \in \mathbb{R}^n \ge 0`` or ``y \in \mathbb{R}^n \ge 0``. They can be used to model processes that, for example, present switches or nonsmooth decisions with the advantage of incorporating discrete decisions in a single nonlinear programming (NLP) formulation[^1].

This library is intended to be a compilation of MPCC (Mathematical Programs with Complementarity Constraints) problems to test algorithms developed in [Julia](https://julialang.org) using [JuMP](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/) as modeling language and to be used as case studies. It also contains an implementation of the first algorithm proposed by Leyffer et al (2006)[^2] that can be used to solve examples in this library.
